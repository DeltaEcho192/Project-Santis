# Project Santis
A small application for personal use, while moving. To create a easy interface 
to itemize all items in our home and where its going. Allowing for the categorisation
of all items and tracking during the move where and which box the given items is.

## Tech Stack
This project is a test of HTMX as a more lightweight alternative to react for 
smaller reactive front end applications.
